# AI vs Human Text Detection 

This is a machine learning project that classifies whether a given piece of text was written by a human or generated by an AI. It includes a Streamlit web app that allows users to upload text files or paste in text for detection of AI use or human using three trained models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and AdaBoost.

# Features

- Upload .txt/.pdf/.docx files or paste/enter raw text directly
- Select a model: SVM, Decision Tree, or AdaBoost
- Get a prediction of "AI" or "Human"
- View model confidence scores
- Visualize important features (in the notebook)

# Machine Learning Models

Three classifiers were trained using TF-IDF features on human vs AI text:

- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Decision Tree
- AdaBoost Classifier

Hyperparameters were tuned using `GridSearchCV`. Models were evaluated using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

# INSTALLATION

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/prajvalmathur/ai-vs-human-text.git
cd ai-vs-human-text

# 2. Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you encounter permission errors:
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# 3. Train the models (if not already done)
Launch the notebook and run all cells:

jupyter notebook
Open:
notebooks/ai_vs_human_detection.ipynb
This will generate and save the trained models to the models/ folder.

# 4. Launch the Streamlit app
python -m streamlit run app.py

The app will open in your browser at:
http://localhost:8501

# Dataset
The training data is stored in:
data/training_data/AI_vs_human_train_dataset.xlsx

It must contain at least two columns:
text – The text content (string)
label – 0 for human-written, 1 for AI-generated

You can modify or extend the dataset to improve accuracy.

# Model Evaluation
Each model was evaluated on:
-Accuracy
-Confusion Matrix
-ROC-AUC Score
-Visualizations are included in the Jupyter notebook (notebooks/ai_vs_human_detection.ipynb).
